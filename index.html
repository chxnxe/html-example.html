  <h2>Web</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
    where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
    (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over
    the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software
    application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed
    the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.
    English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser
    in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was released outside CERN
    to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991.</p>
